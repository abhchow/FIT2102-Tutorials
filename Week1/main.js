/**
    Exercise 1:
    The let and const keywords are for creating mutable and immutable variables 
    respectively.
    Create a mutable variable called ‘aVariable’ and assign its value to 1.
*/
// your first line of code here...

/*
    Create an immutable variable called ‘aConst’ and assign its value to aVariable + 1.
*/
// your second line of code here...

/**
    Exercise 2:
    Create a function called ‘aFunction’ using the function keyword.  
    Inside the function create another variable called 'anotherVariable',
    set its value to 2 and return anotherVariable.

/**
    Exercise 3:
    Make a function called ‘projectEulerProblem1’ that calculates the answer using
    mutable variables, a while loop, and returns the answer.

/**
    Exercise 4:
    Write a function called ‘alwaysTrue’ which always returns true, no matter what argument it is given.
*/

/**
    Write a function called imperativeSummer that takes two parameters: a function f, and a number n.  
    It should use an imperative loop to sum over the numbers from 1 up to (but not including) n,
    including the number x in the sum only if f(x) is true.
*/

/**
    Write a function called sumTo that takes as parameter a number n and
    uses imperativeSummer and alwaysTrue to calculate the sum of all numbers
    from 1 up to (but not including) n.
*/

/**
    Write a function called ‘isDivisibleByThreeOrFive’ which takes a number as parameter,
    tests if it is divisible by 3 or 5, returning true if it is.
*/

/**
    Write a function called projectEulerProblem1UsingImperativeSummer

    again solve Project Euler Problem 1.  It should be one line of code!

/**
    Exercise 5:
    Write a function called 'immutableSummer' with parameters f and n, which computes the sum of numbers
    from 1 up to (but not including) n that satisfy f, but does *not* use while,
    for or any mutable variables (defined with let or var).
    Hint: use recursion!
